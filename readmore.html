                Student Visa
              </h6>
              <p>
              
                A student visa is a special endorsement added to a government passport issued to 
                students enrolled at qualified educational institutions in foreign countries. 
                Student visas are non-immigrant visas that do not require the holder to obtain 
                citizenship. Any prospective student seeking higher education in another country 
                must obtain a student visa from that country. Most countries will issue student 
                visas to allow foreign students to attend school within their borders. However, in 
                most cases, the student must first be enrolled at a post-secondary institution of 
                higher learning.
                International students can work in the foreign countries while studying but there 
                are some restrictions their regarding working hours, per hour salary and work 
                categories.
                Study visa is issued to foreign students pursuing academic /nonacademic degree 
                and research in Nepal. It is issued by the Department of Immigration upon the 
                recommendation of line agency (Ministry of Education). It is also issued to 
                teachers/professors involved in academic work (teaching) in Nepal upon 
                recommendations from the concerned agencies of Nepal Government. It is issued 
                for the periods as per the recommendation or length of study. In most of the 
                countries students get PSW after the completion of their respective studies

                        A tourist visa is the most common type of travel permit. Passengers visiting 
                        another country often need a tourist visa to enter. A tourist visa is an official 
                        document or stamp that authorizes an individual to enter a foreign country for 
                        the purpose of leisure and tourism. Depending on the country, they may also be 
                        referred to as “travel visas”, “visitor visas”, or “temporary stay visas”. A travel visa 
                        for any country is a kind of nonimmigrant visa permitting you to stay in a specific 
                        country for a certain period of time. Tourist visas typically allow the holder to stay 
                        in the host country for a short period. This can range from several days to several 
                        months. During the stay, tourist visa holders are not allowed to work or engage in 
                        non-tourist activities. In some cases, a short-stay visa for a particular country may 
                        permit multiple purposes in addition to tourism, such as business.
                        Many nations have now made it possible to apply for a tourist visa online. This is 
                        the quickest and most straightforward way to obtain one. Every country has its 
                        own visa policy. This outlines the rules for which foreign nationals must have a 
                        tourist visa to enter and the requirements for applying. Tourist visa is one of the 
                        easiest way to go abroad and leave dream life.

                <p>
                
                    Human migration is the movement of people from one place to another with intentions of settling, 
                    permanently or temporarily, at a new location (geographic region). The movement often occurs over 
                    long distances and from one country to another, but internal migration (within a single country) is 
                    also possible; indeed, this is the dominant form of human migration globally. Migration is often 
                    associated with better human capital at both individual and household level, and with better access
                    to migration networks, facilitating a possible second move. Age is also important for both work and 
                    non-work migration. People may migrate as individuals, in family units or in large groups. There are 
                    four major forms of migration: invasion, conquest, colonization.

                Work visas are permits that allow individuals to travel to another country to work there.
                In most cases, a work visa or permit is mandatory to accept employment in a foreign state. There are some exceptions, such as in blocs of countries with a policy of freedom of movement (like the EU).
                Work visas are usually temporary, but may be renewed. Some countries issue permanent work permits or allow holders to change to a residence visa after a certain period of time.
                Various countries have a different system in which foreign nationals must first apply for a long-stay visa and then obtain a work permit once they arrive in the country. A work visa is a type of visa that grants the holder authorization to accept employment in a foreign country. It may be issued as a stamp in the passport or as a separate document.
                It is needed to enter the country for the purpose of performing paid work.
                Work visas may also be needed for volunteering and unpaid internships.
